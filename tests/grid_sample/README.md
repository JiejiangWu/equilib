# Grid Sample Methods

This directory holds previous and baseline methods for benchmarking performance of grid sampling algorithms.

TODO:
- [x] Basic test cases for grid sampling
- [x] Test cases for irregular sampling (e.g., when sampling grid is a circle or deformed)

Future works:
- [ ] spline interpolation like scipy
